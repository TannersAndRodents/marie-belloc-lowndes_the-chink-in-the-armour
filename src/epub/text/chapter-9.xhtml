			<p>A quarter of an hour’s sharp driving brought Sylvia and Madame Wachner to the door of the Casino. They found Madame Wolsky in the hall waiting for them.</p>
			<p>“I couldn’t think what had happened to you!” she exclaimed in an anxious tone. “But here is your membership card, Sylvia. Now you are free of the Baccarat tables!”</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner met his wife with a frowning face. He might be pleased to see Madame Wachner, but he showed his pleasure in an odd manner. Soon, however, the secret of his angry look was revealed, for Madame Wachner opened the leather bag hanging from her wrist and took out of it a hundred francs.</p>
			<p>“Here, Fritz,” she cried, gaily. “You can now begin your play!”</p>
			<p>Sylvia Bailey felt very much amused. So poor “<span xml:lang="fr">Ami</span> Fritz” was not allowed to gamble unless his wife were there to see that he did not go too far. No wonder he had looked impatient and eager, as well as cross! He had been engaged⁠—that was clear⁠—in putting down the turns of the game, and in working out what were no doubt abstruse calculations connected with his system.</p>
			<p>The Club was very full, and it was a little difficult at that hour of the late afternoon to get near enough to a table to play comfortably; but a stranger had kindly kept Anna Wolsky’s place for her.</p>
			<p>“I have been quite lucky,” she whispered to Sylvia. “I have made three hundred francs, and now I think I will rest a bit! Slip in here, dear, and I will stand behind you. I do not advise you to risk more than twenty francs the first time; on the other hand, if you feel <i xml:lang="fr">en veine</i>, if the luck seems persistent⁠—it sometimes is when one first plays with gold⁠—then be bold, and do not hesitate!”</p>
			<p>Sylvia, feeling rather bewildered, slipped into her friend’s place, and Anna kept close behind her.</p>
			<p>With a hand that trembled a little, she put a twenty-franc piece down on the green table. After doing so she looked up, and saw that the <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> was standing nearly opposite to her, on the other side of the table.</p>
			<p>His eyes were fixed on her, and there was a very kind and indulgent, if sad, smile on his face. As their glances met he leant forward and also put a twenty-franc piece on the green cloth close to where Sylvia’s money lay.</p>
			<p>The traditional words rang out: “<i xml:lang="fr">Faites vos jeux, Messieurs, Mesdames! Le jeu est fait! Rien ne va plus!</i>”</p>
			<p>And then Sylvia saw her stake and that of the Count doubled. There were now four gold pieces where two had been.</p>
			<p>“Leave your money on, and see what happens,” whispered Anna. “After all you are only risking twenty francs!”</p>
			<p>And Sylvia obediently followed the advice.</p>
			<p>Again there came a little pause; once more the words which she had not yet learnt to understand rang out in the croupier’s monotonous voice.</p>
			<p>She looked round her; there was anxiety and watchful suspense on all the eager faces. The <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> alone looked indifferent.</p>
			<p>A moment later four gold pieces were added to the four already there.</p>
			<p>“You had better take up your winnings, or someone may claim them,” muttered Anna anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Oh, but I don’t like to do that,” said Sylvia.</p>
			<p>“Of course you must!”</p>
			<p>She put out her hand and took up her four gold pieces, leaving those of the Count on the table. Then suddenly she put back the eighty francs on the cloth, and smiled up at him; it was a gay little shame-faced smile. “Please don’t be cross with me, kind friend,”⁠—that is what Sylvia’s smile seemed to say to <span xml:lang="fr">Paul de Virieu</span>⁠—“but this is so <em>very</em> exciting!”</p>
			<p>He felt stirred to the heart. How sweet, how confidingly simple she looked! And⁠—and how very beautiful. He at once loved and hated to see her there, his new little “<i xml:lang="fr">amie Anglaise</i>!”</p>
			<p>“Are you going to leave the whole of it on this time?” whispered Anna.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I think I will. It’s rather fun. After all, I’m only risking twenty francs!” whispered back Sylvia.</p>
			<p>And once more she won.</p>
			<p>“What a pity you didn’t start playing with a hundred francs! Think of how rich you would be now,” said Anna, with the true gambler’s instinct. “But it is clear, child, that you are going to do well this evening, and I shall follow your luck! Take the money off now, however.”</p>
			<p>Sylvia waited to see what the Count would do. Their eyes asked and answered the same question. He gave an imperceptible nod, and she took up her winnings⁠—eight gold pieces!</p>
			<p>It was well that she had done so, for the next deal of the cards favoured the banker.</p>
			<p>Then something very surprising happened to Sylvia.</p>
			<p>Someone⁠—she thought it was <span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner⁠—addressed the croupier whose duty it was to deal out the cards, and said imperiously, “<i xml:lang="fr">A Madame la main!</i>”</p>
			<p>Hardly knowing what she was doing, Sylvia took up the cards which had been pushed towards her. A murmur of satisfaction ran round the table, for there lay what even she had learnt by now was the winning number, a nine of hearts, and the second card was the king of clubs.</p>
			<p>Again and again, she turned up winning numbers⁠—the eight and the ace, the five and the four, the six and the three⁠—every combination which brought luck to the table and confusion to the banker.</p>
			<p>Eyes full of adoring admiration, aye and gratitude, were turned on the young Englishwoman. <span xml:lang="fr">Paul de Virieu</span> alone did not look at her. But he followed her play.</p>
			<p>“Now put on a hundred francs,” said Anna, authoritatively.</p>
			<p>Sylvia looked at her, rather surprised by the advice, but she obeyed it. And still the <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> followed her lead.</p>
			<p>That made her feel dreadfully nervous and excited⁠—it would be so terrible to make him lose too!</p>
			<p>Neither of them lost. On the contrary, ten napoleons were added to the double pile of gold.</p>
			<p>And then, after that, it seemed as if the whole table were following Sylvia’s game.</p>
			<p>“That pretty Englishwoman is playing for the first time!”⁠—so the word went round. And they all began backing her luck with feverish haste.</p>
			<p>The banker, a good-looking young Frenchman, stared at Sylvia ruefully. Thanks to her, he was being badly punished. Fortunately, he could afford it.</p>
			<p>At the end of half an hour, feeling tired and bewildered by her good fortune, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bailey got up and moved away from the table, the possessor of £92. The <span xml:lang="fr">Comte Virieu</span> had won exactly the same amount.</p>
			<p>Now everybody looked pleased except the banker. For the first time a smile irradiated <span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner’s long face.</p>
			<p>As for Madame Wachner, she was overjoyed. Catching Sylvia by the hand, she exclaimed, in her curious, woolly French, “I would like to embrace you! But I know that English ladies do not like kissing in public. It is splendid⁠—splendid! Look at all the people you have made happy.”</p>
			<p>“But how about the poor banker?” asked Sylvia, blushing.</p>
			<p>“Oh, ’e is all right. ’E is very rich.”</p>
			<p>Madame Wolsky, like the Count, had exactly followed her friend’s play, but not as soon as he had done. Still, she also had made over £80.</p>
			<p>“Two thousand francs!” she cried, joyfully. “That is very good for a beginning. And you?” she turned to <span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner.</p>
			<p>He hesitated, and looked at his wife deprecatingly.</p>
			<p>“<span xml:lang="fr">L’Ami</span>> Fritz,” said Madame Wachner, “<em>will</em> play ’is system, <span xml:lang="fr">Mesdames</span>. However, I am glad to say that to-day he soon gave it up in honour of our friend here. What ’ave you made?” she asked him.</p>
			<p>“Only eight hundred francs,” he said, his face clouding over. “If you had given me more than that hundred francs, Sophie, I might have made five thousand in the time.”</p>
			<p>“Bah!” she said. “That does not matter. We must not risk more than a hundred francs a day⁠—you know how often I’ve told you that, Fritz.” She was now speaking in French, very quickly and angrily.</p>
			<p>But Sylvia hardly heard. She could not help wondering why the Count had not come up and congratulated her. The thought that she had brought him luck was very pleasant to her.</p>
			<p>He had left off playing, and was standing back, near one of the windows. He had not even glanced across to the place where she stood. This aloofness gave Sylvia a curious little feeling of discomfiture. Why, several strangers had come up and cordially thanked her for bringing them such luck.</p>
			<p>“Let us come out of this place and ’ave some ices,” exclaimed Madame Wachner, suddenly. “When <span xml:lang="fr">l’Ami</span> Fritz ’as a stroke of luck ’e often treats ’is old wife to an ice.”</p>
			<p>The four went out of the Casino and across the way to an hotel, which, as Madame Wachner explained to her two new friends, contained the best restaurant in <span xml:lang="fr">Lacville</span>. The sun was sinking, and, though it was still very hot, there was a pleasant breeze coming up from the lake.</p>
			<p>Sylvia felt excited and happy. How wonderful⁠—how marvellous⁠—to make nearly £100 out of a twenty-franc piece! That was what she had done this afternoon.</p>
			<p>And then, rather to her surprise, after they had all enjoyed ices and cakes at Madame Wachner’s expense, Anna Wolsky and <span xml:lang="fr">l’Ami</span> Fritz declared they were going back to the Casino.</p>
			<p>“I don’t mean to play again to-night,” said Sylvia, firmly. “I feel dreadfully tired,” and the excitement had indeed worn her out. She longed to go back to the <span xml:lang="fr">Hôtel du Lac</span>.</p>
			<p>Still, she accompanied the others to the Club, and together with Madame Wachner, she sat down some way from the tables. In a very few minutes they were joined by the other two, who had by now lost quite enough gold pieces to make them both feel angry with themselves, and, what was indeed unfair, with poor Sylvia.</p>
			<p>“I’m sure that if you had played again, and if we had followed your play, we should have added to our winnings instead of losing, as we have done,” said Anna crossly.</p>
			<p>“I’m so sorry,” and Sylvia felt really distressed. Anna had never spoken crossly to her before.</p>
			<p>“Forgive me!” cried the Polish woman, suddenly softening. “I ought not to have said that to you, dear little friend. No doubt we should all have lost just the same. You know that fortune-teller told me that I should make plenty of money⁠—well, even now I have had a splendid day!”</p>
			<p>“Do come back with me and have dinner at the <span xml:lang="fr">Villa du Lac</span>,” said Sylvia eagerly.</p>
			<p>They shook hands with the Wachners, and as they walked the short distance from the Casino to the villa, Sylvia told Anna all about her visit to the <span xml:lang="fr">Châlet des Muguets</span>.</p>
			<p>“They seem nice homely people,” she said, “and Madame Wachner was really very kind.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, no doubt; but she is a very strict wife,” answered Anna smiling. “The poor man had not one penny piece till she came in, and he got so angry and impatient waiting for her! I really felt inclined to lend him a little money; but I have made it a rule never to lend money in a Casino; it only leads to unpleasantness afterwards.”</p>
			<p>In the hall of the <span xml:lang="fr">Villa du Lac</span> the <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> was standing reading a paper. He was dressed for dinner, and he bowed distantly as the two ladies came in.</p>
			<p>“Why, there is the <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span>!” exclaimed Anna, in a low, and far from a pleased tone. “I had no idea he was staying here.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, he is staying here,” said Sylvia, blushing uneasily, and quickly she led the way upstairs. It wanted a few minutes to seven.</p>
			<p>Anna Wolsky waited till the door of Sylvia’s room was shut, and then,</p>
			<p>“I cannot help being sorry that you are staying in the same hotel as that man,” she said, seriously. “Do not get to know him too well, dear Sylvia. The Count is a worthless individual; he has gambled away two fortunes. And now, instead of working, he is content to live on an allowance made to him by his sister’s husband, the <span xml:lang="fr">Duc d’Eglemont</span>. If I were you, I should keep on very distant terms with him. He is, no doubt, always looking out for a nice rich woman to marry.”</p>
			<p>Sylvia made no answer. She felt she could not trust herself to speak; and there came over her a feeling of intense satisfaction that Anna Wolsky was not staying here with her at the <span xml:lang="fr">Villa du Lac</span>.</p>
			<p>She also made up her mind that next time she entertained Anna she would do so at the restaurant of which the cooking had been so highly commended by Madame Wachner.</p>
			<p>The fact that Madame Wolsky thought so ill of the <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> made Sylvia feel uncomfortable all through dinner. But the Count, though he again bowed when the two friends came into the dining-room, did not come over and speak to them, as Sylvia had felt sure he would do this evening.</p>
			<p>After dinner he disappeared, and Sylvia took Anna out into the garden. But she did not show her the <i xml:lang="fr">potager</i>. The old kitchen-garden already held for her associations which she did not wish to spoil or even to disturb.</p>
			<p>Madame Wolsky, sipping <abbr>M.</abbr> <span xml:lang="fr">Polperro</span>’s excellent coffee, again mentioned the Count.</p>
			<p>“I am exceedingly surprised to see him here at <span xml:lang="fr">Lacville</span>,” she said in a musing voice, “I should have expected him to go to a more <i>chic</i> place. He always plays in the winter at Monte Carlo.”</p>
			<p>Sylvia summoned up courage to protest.</p>
			<p>“But, Anna,” she exclaimed, “surely the <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> is only doing what a great many other people do!”</p>
			<p>Anna laughed good-humouredly.</p>
			<p>“I see what you mean,” she said. “You think it is a case of ‘the pot calling the kettle black.’ How excellent are your English proverbs, dear Sylvia! But no, it is quite different. Take me. I have an income, and choose to spend it in gambling. I might prefer to have a big house, or perhaps I should say a small house, for I am not a very rich woman. But no, I like play, and I am free to spend my money as I like. The <span xml:lang="fr">Comte de Virieu</span> is very differently situated! He is, so I’ve been told, a clever, cultivated man. He ought to be working⁠—doing something for his country’s good. And then he is so disagreeable! He makes no friends, no acquaintances. He always looks as if he was doing something of which he was ashamed. He never appears gay or satisfied, not even when he is winning⁠—”</p>
			<p>“He does not look as cross as <span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner,” said Sylvia, smiling.</p>
			<p>“<span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner is like me,” said Anna calmly. “He probably made a fortune in business, and now he and his wife enjoy risking a little money at play. Why should they not?”</p>
			<p>“Madame Wachner told me to-day all about their poor friend who was drowned,” said Sylvia irrelevantly.</p>
			<p>“Ah, yes, that was a sad affair! They were very foolish to become so intimate with him. Why, they actually had him staying with them at the time! You see, they had a villa close to the lake-side. And this young Russian, it appears, was very fond of boating. It was a mysterious affair, because, oddly enough, he had not been out in the town, or even to the Casino, for four days before the accident happened. There was a notion among some people that he had committed suicide, but that, I fancy, was not so. He had won a large sum of money. Some thought the gold weighed down his body in the water⁠—. But that is absurd. It must have been the weeds.”</p>
			<p>“Madame Wachner told me that quite a lot of money was found in his room,” said Sylvia quickly.</p>
			<p>“No, that is not true. About four hundred francs were found in his bed-room. That was all. I fancy the police made themselves rather unpleasant to <span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> Wachner. The Russian Embassy made inquiries, and it seemed so odd to the French authorities that the poor fellow could not be identified. They found no passport, no papers of any sort⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Have you a passport?” asked Sylvia. “Madame Wachner asked me if I had one. But I’ve never even seen a passport!”</p>
			<p>“No,” said Anna, “I have not got a passport now. I once had one, but I lost it. One does not require such a thing in a civilised country! But a Russian must always have a passport, it is an absolute law in Russia. And the disappearance of that young man’s passport was certainly strange⁠—in fact, the whole affair was mysterious.”</p>
			<p>“It must have been terrible for <span xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> and Madame Wachner,” said Sylvia thoughtfully.</p>
			<p>“Oh yes, very disagreeable indeed! Luckily he is entirely absorbed in his absurd systems, and she is a very cheerful woman.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, indeed she is!” Sylvia could not help smiling. “I am glad we have got to know them, Anna. It is rather mournful when one knows no one at all in a place of this kind.”</p>
			<p>And Anna agreed, indifferently.</p>
